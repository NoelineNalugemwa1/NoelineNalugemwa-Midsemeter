<h2> What is Web Development </h2>

</p>

Web development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, designing and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, also include web design, web programming, and database management

<p> 

The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript

</p>

I would advice a company or business to have invest in making its own website due to the following reasons below 

<ul>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
  <li> Effective Marketing Tool</li>
  <li>Professionalism</li>
</ul>

<b><u> Accessibility </u></b> - A company with a website is easily accessible and enables your clients to easily get in touch with you

<p>
<b><u> Effective Marketing Tool </u></b> A website is an excellent marketing tool. Unlike conventional marketing channels, the price of investing in a website is more affordable compared to using Televesion and radio
</p>

<p>
<b><u> Professionalism </u></b> A company with a well designed website gives off the impression of professionalism which attracts more clients
